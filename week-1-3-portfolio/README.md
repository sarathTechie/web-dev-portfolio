# 👤 Personal Developer Portfolio (Week 1-3)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project represents the foundational phase of my Web Development journey. It is a fully responsive personal portfolio website built from scratch using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a semantic, accessible, and visually appealing digital resume to showcase skills and projects.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Dynamic Theme Switcher:** A fully functional Dark/Light mode toggle that saves user preferences to `localStorage`, ensuring the theme persists across page reloads.
* **Responsive Navigation:** A mobile-first navigation bar that transforms into a hamburger menu on smaller screens using CSS Media Queries.
* **Client-Side Validation:** The contact form includes JavaScript logic to validate email formats and ensure message fields are not empty before submission.
* **Smooth Scrolling:** Implemented CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` for a seamless navigation experience between sections.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **HTML5 Semantics:** Utilized proper tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` for better SEO and accessibility.
* **CSS Flexbox:** Used for layout alignment, particularly in the navigation bar and "About Me" section.
* **JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Used `document.querySelector` and `classList.toggle` to handle interactive elements.
