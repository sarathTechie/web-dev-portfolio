Author: Sarath Mohanraj Role: B.Tech (IT) Student, Manipal University Jaipur Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)

Project Overview
This project is a personal portfolio website built from scratch over the course of 3 weeks. It demonstrates a progressive understanding of core web technologies:

Week 1: Constructing the structural foundation using Semantic HTML5.

Week 2: Designing the visual presentation and layout using CSS3 & Flexbox.

Week 3: Adding interactivity, logic, and state management using JavaScript.

The goal was to create a responsive, accessible, and interactive digital resume without relying on frameworks (like Bootstrap or React).

Key Features
HTML5 Structure (Week 1)
Semantic Markup: Uses header, nav, main, section, and footer for better SEO and accessibility.

Forms: A contact form implementing proper input types (email, text) for data collection.

Hyperlinks: Internal anchor links for smooth navigation between "About," "Skills," and "Contact" sections.

CSS3 Styling (Week 2)
Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout that adapts to mobile screens using Media Queries.

Flexbox Layout: Used for the navigation bar to ensure proper alignment across devices.

CSS Variables: Implemented root variables for consistent color management (Theme colors, Spacing).

Interactive UI: Hover effects on buttons and navigation links for better user experience.

JavaScript Interactivity (Week 3)
Dark Mode Toggle: A fully functional theme switcher that toggles between Light and Dark modes.

Local Storage Persistence: Remembers the user's theme preference (Dark/Light) even after refreshing the page.

Form Validation: Client-side validation prevents empty submissions and ensures valid email formats before sending.

DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updates content and CSS classes based on user actions.
